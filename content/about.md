Welcome to my site. 

I am a full-stack and mobile software developer based in Cleveland, Ohio. My 
main interests are anything related to JavaScript, Go, and Rust. Additionally, 
I am [AWS certified](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&t=c&d=2018-09-08&ci=AWS00490765).  

I have experience writing apps using (but not limited to):

- React / React Native
- Android
- AWS (mostly RDS, AppSync, and Lambda)

My GitHub is filled with various projects and experiments.

**I am currently available for hire for freelancing projects.** Please note
though that I do have a day job, and I must be able to work around that.
So if you're looking for a driven and passionate developer for your project,
please email me!
