## Who?

I'm a developer living in Cleveland, Ohio. My interests include web development,
programming languages, and, increasingly, systems programming.

Much of my professional work is web development-related. I've been writing 
JavaScript since 2014 and I know my way around many big frameworks.
Projects outside of work tend to be related to web development or Rust.

## Projects

Some fun projects I've worked on recently:

- [dial](https://github.com/rfaulhaber/dial), a Lisp interpreter inspired by [make a lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).
- [sc](https://github.com/rfaulhaber/sc), a simple `dc` clone written in Rust.
- [janus](https://github.com/rfaulhaber/janus-proto), a clone of [Acme](http://acme.cat-v.org/) built during a hackathon.

I'm hoping to start contributing to open source projects as well!

## Working with me

If you are in need of software development work on a contractual, part time
basis (that is, you don't mind me working in the evenings!), please get in
touch. I'm familiar with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, tools, and
platforms. If there's something I don't know, I trust that I can figure it out
quickly.

My experience, as stated partially above, includes:

- Web development (JavaScript, React)
- Mobile development (Android with Java and Kotlin, React Native)
- Development on Amazon Web Services (especially AppSync, DynamoDB, RDS, EC2, ECS)

I am [AWS certified](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&t=c&d=2018-09-08&ci=AWS00490765).
