Hello!

I'm a software developer based in Cleveland, Ohio. I have a wide range of
software interests, ranging from plain old JavaScript development to 
programming language theory.

I have been writing JavaScript code since 2014 and consider myself to be
something of an advocate for the language. Much of my framework-related
experience is with React and React Native. I'm also currently messing around
with Vue and Electron. My first professional work in software development was
web application development with JavaScript.

I've been a Linux user for even longer, and the Unix philosophy is always in
the back of my mind. I'm passionate about Unix-like systems, as I feel that 
they are the only operating systems suitable for software development and for
use as servers.

Above all else, I think code should be simple, readable, and modular. How that
is achieved depends on many factors, and though I don't think there's one magic
bullet to solve this problem, I think it should be a priority in how code and
software is written. Some time ago I was struck by the simple elegance of 
conventions in Unix. Being able to write commands like:

```bash
$ echo "8 6 7 5 3 0 9" | tr " " "\n" | sort
```

left quite an impression on me.

Similarly, learning about functional programming has also left an impression on
me. Thinking of programs as transformations of data has been revelatory, and
influences all the code I write, functional or not. It has also helped me
achieve my goals of writing simple, readable, and modular code.

Recently I've been writing a [lot](https://github.com/rfaulhaber/dial) [of](https://github.com/rfaulhaber/sc)
[Rust](https://github.com/rfaulhaber/janus-proto). It's a language I've become
quite passionate about. Its static typing, elegant syntax, modern design, and
memory safety make it quite appealing to me.


## Working with me

If you are in need of software development work on a contractual, part time
basis (that is, you don't mind me working in the evenings!), please get in
touch. I'm familiar with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, tools, and
platforms. If there's something I don't know, I trust that I can figure it out
quickly.

My experience, as stated partially above, includes:

- Web development (JavaScript, React)
- Mobile development (Android with Java and Kotlin, React Native)
- Development on Amazon Web Services (especially AppSync, DynamoDB, RDS, EC2, ECS)

I am [AWS certified](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&t=c&d=2018-09-08&ci=AWS00490765).
