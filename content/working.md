If you are in need of software development work on a contractual, part time
basis (that is, you don't mind me working in the evenings!), please get in
touch. I'm familiar with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, tools, and
platforms. If there's something I don't know, I trust that I can figure it out
quickly.

My experience, as stated partially above, includes:

- Web development (JavaScript, React)
- Mobile development (Android with Java and Kotlin, React Native)
- Development on Amazon Web Services (especially AppSync, DynamoDB, RDS, EC2, ECS)

I am [AWS certified](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&t=c&d=2018-09-08&ci=AWS00490765).
