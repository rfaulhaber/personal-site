I am an experienced software developer focusing mostly on full-stack web and mobile development. **I am available to work on new projects part-time**.

Over the last few years of my professional life I've worked in full-stack web and mobile development, and I have a limited amount of systems programming via the Rust programming language. I'm experienced with all things JavaScript in particular.

I am most engaged in my work when I am able to work on complex problems with open-ended solutions. I enjoy working with like-minded engineers to solve interesting problems. I'm obsessive over building adaptable systems and feel very strongly about software modularity. To me, there's no problem too big or complex.

If I sound like I could be a good fit, please [email me](mailto:ryan@sys9.net).
