If you are in need of some temporary, part-time freelance work (that is, you
don't mind me working in the evenings! I do have a full-time job!), please get
in touch. I'm familiar with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, tools, and
platforms. If there's something I don't know, I trust that I can figure it out
quickly.

My experience, as stated partially above, includes:

- Full-stack web development 
  - Front-end (JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React, Angular)
  - Back-end (Go, Rust, Node.js)
- Mobile development (Android with Java and Kotlin, React Native)
- Development on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
