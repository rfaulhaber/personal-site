## Who? {#who}

I'm a developer living in Cleveland, Ohio. My interests include web development, programming languages, and, increasingly, systems programming.

Much of my professional work is web development-related. I've been writing JavaScript since 2014 and I know my way around many big frameworks. Projects outside of work tend to be related to web development or Rust.


## Projects {#projects}

All my projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rfaulhaber).

On top of that, I'm currently looking to contribute to open source projects and interested in pursuing freelance work!
