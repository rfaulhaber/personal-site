<meta name=description content="I am an experienced software developer focusing mostly on full-stack web and mobile development. I am available to work on new projects part-time.
Over the last few years of my professional life I&rsquo;ve worked in full-stack web and mobile development, and I have a limited amount of systems programming via the Rust programming language. I&rsquo;m experienced with all things JavaScript in particular.
I am most engaged in my work when I am able to work on complex problems with open-ended solutions. I enjoy working with like-minded engineers to solve interesting problems. I&rsquo;m obsessive over building adaptable systems and feel very strongly about software modularity. To me, there&rsquo;s no problem too big or complex."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:url" content="/working/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Ryan Faulhaber"><meta property="og:title" content="Working With Me"><meta property="og:description" content="I am an experienced software developer focusing mostly on full-stack web and mobile development.
