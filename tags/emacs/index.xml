&lt;p>One of the first things I did when I became a Linux user was to learn how to use the terminal. The terminal is an indispensable tool in the Unix world broadly because of its versatility. I got to a point where I used the terminal so heavily that eventually on Linux I stopped installing file explorers, and on macOS I had entire directories that never had those annoying &lt;code>.DS_Store&lt;/code> files. Personally, managing files in the terminal is often much simpler and more direct than a graphical file explorer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cool Emacs Things: Magit</title><link>/posts/cool-emacs-magit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2020 15:46:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/cool-emacs-magit/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is part of an &lt;a href="https://ryanfaulhaber.com/series/cool-emacs-things">ongoing series&lt;/a> where I talk about the little things that make Emacs a nice editor. Today&amp;rsquo;s entry: &lt;a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit&lt;/a>, a Git interface for Emacs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a Git client person myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t use or particularly like Sourcetree or GitKraken. VS Code and JetBrains IDEs have some nice features, especially when it comes to merging and rebasing, but they&amp;rsquo;re still not quite like Magit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cool Emacs Things: Edit Files Over SSH</title><link>/posts/cool-emacs-tramp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 14:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/cool-emacs-tramp/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first installment of an indefinite series calling (in lieu of a better name) &amp;ldquo;Cool Emacs Things,&amp;rdquo; little things about Emacs that makes it a very handy editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s entry: Editing files over SSH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was something I discovered recently by accident. I run a private email server and the IMAP portion of the server is handled by &lt;a href="https://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot&lt;/a>. Dovecot is great but by default the configuration is spread across dozens of files, and, while trying to tediously edit multiple files over SSH in Vim, I thought, &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if I could do this with Emacs?&amp;rdquo; Well guess what!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing an Emacs module in Rust</title><link>/posts/first-emacs-module-rust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-emacs-module-rust/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I learned that Emacs supports linking with dynamic modules, so I tried writing one in Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ways Emacs Has Changed What I Do</title><link>/posts/things-emacs-has-changed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/things-emacs-has-changed/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://ryanfaulhaber.com/posts/try-emacs/">Previously&lt;/a> I had written about trying Emacs, but looking back on that post I felt like I was bit vague about the ways in which it&amp;rsquo;s changed the things I do, so I wanted to provide some examples. Emacs has replaced a number of programs in my life, and not all of them are developer related.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Should Try Emacs</title><link>/posts/try-emacs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 16:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/try-emacs/</guid><description>&lt;p>No, really, you should try Emacs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
