I enjoy doing coding challenges but I&amp;rsquo;m not competitive about it, so I tend to use them as a learning opportunity. Like for most people, the end of the year is a time of reflection, and when I look back on what I wanted to do this year, I often found myself saying &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s a language I wish I knew better.&amp;rdquo; So, I thought, what better way to turn that potential regret into an opportunity, and use Advent of Code to try out a bunch of languages!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
